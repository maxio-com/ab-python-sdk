        [reactivation](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/440789873

        + The method works for "Canceled" or "Trial Ended" subscriptions.

        ## Resume the current billing period for a subscription
        A subscription is considered "resumable" if you are attempting to
        reactivate within the billing period the subscription was canceled
        in.
        A resumed subscription's billing date remains the same as before it
        was canceled. In other words, it does not start a new billing period.
        Payment may or may not be collected for a resumed subscription,
        depending on whether or not the subscription had a balance when it was
        canceled (for example, if it was canceled because of dunning).
        Consider a subscription which was created on June 1st, and would renew
        on July 1st. The subscription is then canceled on June 15.
        If a reactivation with `resume: true` were attempted _before_ what
        would have been the next billing date of July 1st, then Chargify would
        resume the subscription.
        If a reactivation with `resume: true` were attempted _after_ what
        would have been the next billing date of July 1st, then Chargify would
        not resume the subscription, and instead it would be reactivated with
        a new billing period.
        | Canceled | Reactivation | Resumable? |
        |---|---|---|
        | Jun 15 | June 28 | Yes |
        | Jun 15 | July 2 | No |
        ## Reactivation Scenarios
        ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription While Preserving Balance
        + Given you have a product that costs $20
        + Given you have a canceled subscription to the $20 product
            + 1 charge should exist for $20
            + 1 payment should exist for $20
        + When the subscription has canceled due to dunning, it retained a
        negative balance of $20
        #### Results
        The resulting charges upon reactivation will be:
        + 1 charge for $20 for the new product
        + 1 charge for $20 for the balance due
        + Total charges = $40
        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The subscription balance will be zero
        ### Reactivating a Canceled Subscription With Coupon
        + Given you have a canceled subscription
        + It has no current period defined
        + You have a coupon code "EARLYBIRD"
        + The coupon is set to recur for 6 periods
        PUT request sent to:
        `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.j
        son?coupon_code=EARLYBIRD`
        #### Results
        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The subscription should have applied a coupon with code "EARLYBIRD"
        ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription With a Trial, Without the
        include_trial Flag
        + Given you have a canceled subscription
        + The product associated with the subscription has a trial
        + PUT request to
        `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.j
        son`
        #### Results
        + The subscription will transition to active
        ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription With Trial, With the
        include_trial Flag
        + Given you have a canceled subscription
        + The product associated with the subscription has a trial
        + Send a PUT request to
        `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.j
        son?include_trial=1`
        #### Results
        + The subscription will transition to trialing
        ### Reactivating Trial Ended Subscription
        + Given you have a trial_ended subscription
        + Send a PUT request to
        `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.j
        son`
        #### Results
        + The subscription will transition to active
        ### Resuming a Canceled Subscription
        + Given you have a `canceled` subscription and it is resumable
        + Send a PUT request to
        `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.j
        son?resume=true`
        #### Results
        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The next billing date should not have changed
        ### Attempting to resume a subscription which is not resumable
        + Given you have a `canceled` subscription, and it is not resumable
        + Send a PUT request to
        `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.j
        son?resume=true`
        #### Results
        + The subscription will transition to active, with a new billing
        period.
        ### Attempting to resume but not reactivate a subscription which is
        not resumable
        + Given you have a `canceled` subscription, and it is not resumable
        + Send a PUT request to
        `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.j
        son?resume[require_resume]=true`
        + The response status should be "422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY"
        + The subscription should be canceled with the following response
        ```
          {
            "errors": ["Request was 'resume only', but this subscription
            cannot be resumed."]
          }
        ```
        #### Results
        + The subscription should remain `canceled`
        + The next billing date should not have changed
        ### Resuming Subscription Which Was Trialing
        + Given you have a `trial_ended` subscription, and it is resumable
        + And the subscription was canceled in the middle of a trial
        + And there is still time left on the trial
        + Send a PUT request to
        `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.j
        son?resume=true`

        """Does a POST request to /subscriptions/{subscription_id}/renewals/preview.json.

        The Chargify API allows you to preview a renewal by posting to the
        renewals endpoint. Renewal Preview is an object representing a
        subscription’s next assessment. You can retrieve it to see a snapshot
        of how much your customer will be charged on their next renewal.
        The "Next Billing" amount and "Next Billing" date are already
        represented in the UI on each Subscriber's Summary. For more
        information, please see our documentation
        [here](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407884887835#nex
        t-billing).
        ## Optional Component Fields
        This endpoint is particularly useful due to the fact that it will
        return the computed billing amount for the base product and the
        components which are in use by a subscriber.
        By default, the preview will include billing details for all
        components _at their **current** quantities_. This means:
        * Current `allocated_quantity` for quantity-based components
        * Current enabled/disabled status for on/off components
        * Current metered usage `unit_balance` for metered components
        * Current metric quantity value for events recorded thus far for
        events-based components
        In the above statements, "current" means the quantity or value as of
        the call to the renewal preview endpoint. We do not predict
        end-of-period values for components, so metered or events-based usage
        may be less than it will eventually be at the end of the period.
        Optionally, **you may provide your own custom quantities** for any
        component to see a billing preview for non-current quantities. This is
        accomplished by sending a request body with data under the
        `components` key. See the request body documentation below.
        ## Subscription Side Effects
        You can request a `POST` to obtain this data from the endpoint without
        any side effects. Plain and simple, this will preview data, not log
        any changes against a subscription.
