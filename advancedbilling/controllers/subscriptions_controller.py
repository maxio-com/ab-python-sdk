        821-Imports)
        When creating a subscription, you must specify a product and a
        customer. Credit card details may be required, depending on the
        options for the Product being subscribed ([see Product
        Options](https://maxio-chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/540524678
        2221#payment-method-settings)).
        The product may be specified by `product_id` or by `product_handle`
        (API Handle). In similar fashion, to pass a particular product price
        point, you may either use `product_price_point_handle` or
        `product_price_point_id`.
        An existing customer may be specified by a `customer_id` (ID within
        Chargify) or a `customer_reference` (unique value within your app that
        you have shared with Chargify via the reference attribute on a
        customer). You may also pass in an existing payment profile for that
        customer with `payment_profile_id`. A new customer may be created by
        providing `customer_attributes`.
        Credit card details may be required, depending on the options for the
        product being subscribed. The product can be specified by `product_id`
        or by `product_handle` (API Handle).
        If you are creating a subscription with a payment profile, the
        attribute to send will be `credit_card_attributes` or
        `bank_account_attributes` for ACH and Direct Debit. That said, when
        you read the subscription after creation, we return the profile
        details under `credit_card` or `bank_account`.
        ## Taxable Subscriptions
        If your intent is to charge your subscribers tax via [Avalara
        Taxes](https://maxio-chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/54052757118
        85-Avalara-VAT-Tax) or [Custom
        Taxes](https://maxio-chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/54050690415
        49-Custom-Taxes), there are a few considerations to be made regarding
        collecting subscription data.
        For subscribers to be eligible to be taxed, the following information
        for the `customer` object or `payment_profile` object must by
        supplied:
        + A subscription to a [taxable
        product](https://maxio-chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/540524678
        2221-Product-Editing#tax-settings)
        + [Full valid billing or shipping
        address](https://maxio-chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/540535611
        4317#full-address-required-for-taxable-subscriptions) to identify the
        tax locale
        + The portion of the address that houses the [state
        information](https://maxio-chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/54053
        56114317#required-state-format-for-taxable-subscriptions) of either
        adddress must adhere to the ISO standard of a 2-3 character
        limit/format.
        + The portion of the address that houses the [country
        information](https://maxio-chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/54053
        56114317#required-country-format-for-taxable-subscriptions) must
        adhere to the ISO standard of a 2 character limit/format.
        ## Subscription Request Examples
        The subscription examples below will be split into two sections.
        The first section, "Subscription Customization", will focus on passing
        different information with a subscription, such as components,
        calendar billing, and custom fields. These examples will presume you
        are using a secure `chargify_token` generated by Chargify.js.
        The second section, "Passing Payment Information", will focus on
        passing payment information into Chargify. Please be aware that
        <b>collecting and sending Chargify raw card details requires PCI
        compliance on your end</b>; these examples are provided as guidance.
        If your business is not PCI compliant, we recommend using Chargify.js
        to collect credit cards or bank accounts.
        # Subscription Customization
        ## With Components
        Different components require slightly different data. For example,
        quantity-based and on/off components accept `allocated_quantity`,
        while metered components accept `unit_balance`.
        When creating a subscription with a component, a `price_point_id` can
        be passed in along with the `component_id` to specify which price
        point to use. If not passed in, the default price point will be used.
        Note: if an invalid `price_point_id` is used, the subscription will
        still proceed but will use the component's default price point.
        Components and their price points may be added by ID or by handle. See
        the example request body labeled "Components By Handle
        (Quantity-Based)"; the format will be the same for other component
        types.
        ## With Coupon(s)
        Pass an array of `coupon_codes`. See the example request body "With
        Coupon".
        ## With Manual Invoice Collection
        The `invoice` collection method works only on legacy Statement
        Architecture.
        On Relationship Invoicing Architecture use the `remittance` collection
        method.
        ## Prepaid Subscription
        A prepaid subscription can be created with the usual subscription
        creation parameters, specifying `prepaid` as the
        `payment_collection_method` and including a nested
        `prepaid_configuration`.
        After a prepaid subscription has been created, additional funds can be
        manually added to the prepayment account through the [Create
        Prepayment
        Endpoint](https://developers.chargify.com/docs/api-docs/7ec482de77ba7-c
        reate-prepayment).
        Prepaid subscriptions do not work on legacy Statement Architecture.
        ## With Metafields
        Metafields can either attach to subscriptions or customers. Metafields
        are popuplated with the supplied metadata to the resource specified.
        If the metafield doesn't exist yet, it will be created on-the-fly.
        ## With Custom Pricing
        Custom pricing is pricing specific to the subscription in question.
        Create a subscription with custom pricing by passing pricing
        information instead of a price point.
        For a custom priced product, pass the custom_price object in place of
        `product_price_point_id`. For a custom priced component, pass the
        `custom_price` object within the component object.
        Custom prices and price points can exist in harmony on a
        subscription.
        # Passing Payment Information
        ## Subscription with Chargify.js token
        The `chargify_token` can be obtained using
        [chargify.js](https://developers.chargify.com/docs/developer-docs/ZG9jO
        jE0NjAzNDI0-overview). The token represents payment profile attributes
        that were provided by the customer in their browser and stored at the
        payment gateway.
        The `payment_type` attribute may either be `credit_card` or
        `bank_account`, depending on the type of payment method being added.
        If a bank account is being passed, the payment attributes should be
        changed to `bank_account_attributes`.
        ```json
        {
          "subscription": {
            "product_handle": "pro-plan",
            "customer_attributes": {
              "first_name": "Joe",
              "last_name": "Smith",
              "email": "j.smith@example.com"
            },

              "chargify_token": "tok_cwhvpfcnbtgkd8nfkzf9dnjn",

            }
          }
        }
        ```
        ## Subscription with vault token
        If you already have a customer and card stored in your payment
        gateway, you may create a subscription with a `vault_token`. 
        Providing the last_four, card type and expiration date will allow the
        card to be displayed properly in the Chargify UI.
        ```json
        {
          "subscription": {
            "product_handle": "pro-plan",

              "first_name": "Joe",
              "last_name": "Smith",
              "email": "j.smith@example.com"
            },
            "credit_card_attributes": {
              first_name: "Joe,
              last_name: "Smith",
              card_type: "visa",

              current_vault: "braintree_blue"
          }
        }

        ## 3D Secure - Stripe
        It may happen that a payment needs 3D Secure Authentication when the
        subscription is created; this is referred to in our help docs as a
        [post-authentication
        flow](https://maxio-chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/540517743207
        7#psd2-flows-pre-authentication-and-post-authentication). The server
        returns `422 Unprocessable Entity` in this case with the following
        response:
        ```json
        {
          "errors": [
            "Your card was declined. This transaction requires 3D secure
            authentication."
          ],
          "gateway_payment_id": "pi_1F0aGoJ2UDb3Q4av7zU3sHPh",
          "description": "This card requires 3D secure authentication.

          redirect_url param to this URL if you want to redirect a customer
          back to your page after 3D Secure authentication. Example:
          https://mysite.chargify.com/3d-secure/pi_1FCm4RKDeye4C0XfbqquXRYm?one

          ime_token_id=242"
        }
        ```
        To let the customer go through 3D Secure Authentication, they need to
        be redirected to the URL specified in `action_link`.
        Optionally, you can specify `callback_url` parameter in the
        `action_link` URL if you’d like to be notified about the result of 3D
        Secure Authentication. The `callback_url` will return the following
        information:
        - whether the authentication was successful (`success`)
        - the gateway ID for the payment (`gateway_payment_id`)
        - the subscription ID (`subscription_id`)
        Lastly, you can also specify a `redirect_url` within the `action_link`
        URL if you’d like to redirect a customer back to your site.
        It is not possible to use `action_link` in an iframe inside a custom
        application. You have to redirect the customer directly to the
        `action_link`, then, to be notified about the result, use
        `redirect_url` or `callback_url`.
        The final URL that you send a customer to to complete 3D Secure may
        resemble the following, where the first half is the `action_link` and
        the second half contains a `redirect_url` and `callback_url`:
        `https://mysite.chargify.com/3d-secure/pi_1FCm4RKDeye4C0XfbqquXRYm?one_
        time_token_id=128&callback_url=https://localhost:4000&redirect_url=http

        ne_time_token_id=123&callback_url=https://localhost:4000&redirect_url=h
        ttps://yourpage.com`
        ### Example Redirect Flow
        You may wish to redirect customers to different pages depending on
        whether their SCA was performed successfully. Here's an example flow
        to use as a reference:
        1. Create a subscription via API; it requires 3DS
        2. You receive a `gateway_payment_id` in the `action_link` along other
        params in the response.
        3. Use this `gateway_payment_id` to, for example, connect with your
        internal resources or generate a session_id
        4. Include 1 of those attributes inside the `callback_url` and
        `redirect_url` to be aware which “session” this applies to
        5. Redirect the customer to the `action_link` with `callback_url` and
        `redirect_url` applied
        6. After the customer finishes 3DS authentication, we let you know the
        result by making a request to applied `callback_url`.
        7. After that, we redirect the customer to the `redirect_url`; at this
        point the result of authentication is known
        8. Optionally, you can use the applied "msg" param in the
        `redirect_url` to determine whether it was successful or not
        ## Subscriptions Import
        Subscriptions can be “imported” via the API to handle the following
        scenarios:
        + You already have existing subscriptions with specific start and
        renewal dates that you would like to import to Chargify
        + You already have credit cards stored in your provider’s vault and
        you would like to create subscriptions using those tokens
        Before importing, you should have already set up your products to
        match your offerings. Then, you can create Subscriptions via the API
        just like you normally would, but using a few special attributes.
        Full documentation on how import Subscriptions using the **import
        tool** in the Chargify UI can be located
        [here](https://maxio-chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/54048636558
        21#imports-0-0).
        ### Important Notices and Disclaimers regarding Imports
        Before performing a bulk import of subscriptions via the API, we
        suggest reading the [Subscriptions
        Import](https://maxio-chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5404863655
        821#important-notices-and-disclaimers) instructions to understand the
        repurcussions of a large import.
        ### Subscription Input Attributes
        The following _additional_ attributes to the subscription input
        attributes make imports possible: `next_billing_at`,
        `previous_billing_at`, and `import_mrr`.
        ### Current Vault
        If you are using a Legacy gateway such as "eWAY Rapid (Legacy)" or
        "Stripe (Legacy)" then please contact Support for further instructions
        on subscription imports.
        ### Braintree Blue (Braintree v2) Imports
        Braintree Blue is Braintree’s newer (version 2) API. For this gateway,
        please provide the `vault_token` parameter with the value from
        Braintree’s “Customer ID” rather than the “Payment Profile Token”. At
        this time we do not use `current_vault_token` with the Braintree Blue
        gateway, and we only support a single payment profile per Braintree
        Customer.
        When importing PayPal type payment profiles, please set `payment_type`
        to `paypal_account`.
        ### Stripe ACH Imports
        If the bank account has already been verified, currently you will need
        to create the customer, create the payment profile in Chargify -
        setting verified=true, then create a subscription using the
        customer_id and payment_profile_id.
        ### Webhooks During Import
        If no `next_billing_at` is provided, webhooks will be fired as normal.
        If you do set a future `next_billing_at`, only a subset of the
        webhooks are fired when the subscription is created. Keep reading for
        more information as to what webhooks will be fired under which
        scenarios.
        #### Successful creation with Billing Date
        Scenario: If `next_billing_at` provided
        + `signup_success`
        + `billing_date_change`
        #### Successful creation without Billing Date
        Scenario: If no `next_billing_at` provided
        + `signup_success`
        + `payment_success`
        #### Unsuccessful creation
        Scenario: If card can’t be charged, and no `next_billing_at` provided
        + signup_failure
        #### Webhooks fired when next_billing_at is reached:
        + `renewal_success or renewal_failure`
        + `payment_success or payment_failure`
        ### Date and Time Formats
        We will attempt to parse any string you send as the value of
        next_billing_at in to a date or time. For best results, use a known
        format like described in “Date and Time Specification” of RFC 2822 or
        ISO 8601 .
        The following are all equivalent and will work as input to
        `next_billing_at`:
        ```
        Aug 06 2030 11:34:00 -0400
        Aug 06 2030 11:34 -0400
        2030-08-06T11:34:00-04:00
        8/6/2030 11:34:00 EDT
        8/6/2030 8:34:00 PDT
        2030-08-06T15:34:00Z
        ```
        You may also pass just a date, in which case we will assume the time
        to be noon
        ```
        2010-08-06
        ```
        ## Subscription Hierarchies & WhoPays
        When subscription groups were first added to our Relationship
        Invoicing architecture, to group together invoices for related
        subscriptions and allow for complex customer hierarchies and WhoPays
        scenarios, they were designed to consist of a primary and a collection
        of group members. The primary would control many aspects of the group,
        such as when the consolidated invoice is generated. As of today,
        groups still function this way.
        In the future, the concept of a "primary" will be removed in order to
        offer more flexibility into group management and reduce confusion
        concerning what actions must be done on a primary level, rather than a
        member level.
        We have introduced a two scheme system as a bridge between these two
        group organizations. Scheme 1, which is relevant to all subscription
        groups today, marks the group as being "ruled" by a primary.
        When reading a subscription via API, they will return a top-level
        attribute called `group`, which will denote which scheme is being
        used. At this time, the `scheme` attribute will always be 1.
        ### Subscription in a Customer Hierarchy
        For sites making use of the [Relationship
        Billing](https://maxio-chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/540507879
        4253-Introduction-to-Invoices) and [Customer
        Hierarchy](https://maxio-chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5404900
        384141) features, it is possible to create subscriptions within a
        customer hierarchy.  This can be achieved through the API by passing
        group parameters in the **Create Subscription** request.
        + The `group` parameters are optional and consist of the required
        `target` and optional `billing` parameters.
        When the `target` parameter specifies a customer that is already part
        of a hierarchy, the new subscription will become a member of the
        customer hierarchy as well.  If the target customer is not part of a
        hierarchy, a new customer hierarchy will be created and both the
        target customer and the new subscription will become part of the
        hierarchy with the specified target customer set as the responsible
        payer for the hierarchy's subscriptions.
        Rather than specifying a customer, the `target` parameter could
        instead simply have a value of `self` which indicates the subscription
        will be paid for not by some other customer, but by the subscribing
        customer.  This will be true whether the customer is being created
        new, is already part of a hierarchy, or already exists outside a
        hierarchy.  A valid payment method must also be specified in the
        subscription parameters.
        Note that when creating subscriptions in a customer hierarchy, if the
        customer hierarchy does not already have a payment method, passing
        valid credit card attributes in the subscription parameters will also
        result in the payment method being established as the default payment
        method for the customer hierarchy irrespective of the responsible
        payer.
        The optional `billing` parameters specify how some aspects of the
        billing for the new subscription should be handled.  Rather than
        capturing payment immediately, the `accrue` parameter can be included
        so that the new subscription charges accrue until the next assessment
        date.  Regarding the date, the `align_date` parameter can be included
        so that the billing date of the new subscription matches up with the
        default subscription group in the customer hierarchy.  When choosing
        to align the dates, the `prorate` parameter can also be specified so
        that the new subscription charges are prorated based on the billing
        period of the default subscription group in the customer hierarchy
        also.
        ### Subscription in a Subscription Group
        For sites making use of [Relationship
        Billing](https://maxio-chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/540507879
        4253-Introduction-to-Invoices) it may be desireable to create a
        subscription as part of a [subscription
        group](https://maxio-chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/54055773561
        73) in order to rely on [invoice
        consolidation](https://maxio-chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/540
        4980119949). This can be achieved through the API by passing group
        parameters in the Create Subscription request.  The `group` parameters
        are optional and consist of the required `target` and optional
        `billing` parameters.
        The `target` parameters specify an existing subscription with which
        the newly created subscription should be grouped.  If the target
        subscription is already part of a group, the new subscription will
        become a member of the group as well.  If the target subscription is
        not part of a group, a new group will be created and both the target
        and the new subscription will become part of the group with the target
        as the group's primary subscription.
        The optional `billing` parameters specify how some aspects of the
        billing for the new subscription should be handled.  Rather than
        capturing payment immediately, the `accrue` parameter can be included
        so that the new subscription charges accrue until the next assessment
        date.  Regarding the date, the `align_date` parameter can be included
        so that the billing date of the new subscription matches up with the
        target subscription.  When choosing to align the dates, the `prorate`
        parameter can also be specified so that the new subscription charges
        are prorated based on the billing period of the target subscription
        also.
        ## Providing Agreement Acceptance Params
        It is possible to provide a proof of customer's acceptance of terms
        and policies.
        We will be storing this proof in case it might be required (i.e.
        chargeback).
        Currently, we already keep it for subscriptions created via Public
        Signup Pages.
        In order to create a subscription with the proof of agreement
        acceptance, you must provide additional parameters `agreement
        acceptance` with `ip_address` and at least one url to the policy that
        was accepted: `terms_url` or `privacy_policy_url`. Additional urls
        that can be provided: `return_refund_policy_url`,
        `delivery_policy_url` and
        `secure_checkout_policy_url`.
        ```json
          "subscription": {
            "product_handle": "gold-product",
            "customer_attributes": {
              "first_name": "Jane",
              "last_name": "Doe",
              "email": "jd@chargify.test"
            },
            "agreement_acceptance": {
              "ip_address": "1.2.3.4",
              "terms_url": "https://terms.url",
              "privacy_policy_url": "https://privacy_policy.url",
              "return_refund_policy_url": "https://return_refund_policy.url",
              "delivery_policy_url": "https://delivery_policy.url",
              "secure_checkout_policy_url":
              "https://secure_checkout_policy.url"
            }
          }
        }
        ```
        **For Maxio Payments subscriptions, the agreement acceptance params
        are required, with at least terms_url provided.**
        ## Providing ACH Agreement params
        It is also possible to provide a proof that a customer authorized ACH
        agreement terms.
        The proof will be stored and the email will be sent to the customer
        with a copy of the terms (if enabled).
        In order to create a subscription with the proof of authorized ACH
        agreement terms, you must provide the additional parameter
        `ach_agreement` with the following nested parameters:
        `agreement_terms`, `authorizer_first_name`, `authorizer_last_name` and
        `ip_address`.
        Each of them is required.
        ```json
          "subscription": {
            "product_handle": "gold-product",
            "customer_attributes": {
              "first_name": "Jane",
              "last_name": "Doe",

              "authorizer_first_name": "Jane",
              "authorizer_last_name": "Doe",
              "ip_address": "1.2.3.4"

                        consume the results. You do this by passing in a page
                        parameter. Retrieve the next page by adding ?page=2 to
                        the query string. If there are no results to return,

        """Does a PUT request to /subscriptions/{subscription_id}.json.

        The subscription endpoint allows you to instantly update one or many
        attributes about a subscription in a single call.
        ## Update Subscription Payment Method
        Change the card that your Subscriber uses for their subscription. You
        can also use this method to simply change the expiration date of the
        card **if your gateway allows**.
        Note that partial card updates for **Authorize.Net** are not allowed
        via this endpoint. The existing Payment Profile must be directly
        updated instead.
        You also use this method to change the subscription to a different
        product by setting a new value for product_handle. A product change
        can be done in two different ways, **product change** or **delayed
        product change**.
        ## Product Change
        This endpoint may be used to change a subscription's product. The new
        payment amount is calculated and charged at the normal start of the
        next period. If you desire complex product changes or prorated
        upgrades and downgrades instead, please see the documentation on
        Migrating Subscription Products.
        To perform a product change, simply set either the `product_handle` or
        `product_id` attribute to that of a different product from the same
        site as the subscription. You can also change the price point by
        passing in either `product_price_point_id` or
        `product_price_point_handle` - otherwise the new product's default
        price point will be used.
        ### Delayed Product Change
        This method also changes the product and/or price point, and the new
        payment amount is calculated and charged at the normal start of the
        next period.
        This method schedules the product change to happen automatically at
        the subscription’s next renewal date. To perform a Delayed Product
        Change, set the `product_handle` attribute as you would in a regular
        product change, but also set the `product_change_delayed` attribute to
        `true`. No proration applies in this case.
        You can also perform a delayed change to the price point by passing in
        either `product_price_point_id` or `product_price_point_handle`
        **Note: To cancel a delayed product change, set `next_product_id` to
        an empty string.**
        ## Billing Date Changes
        ### Regular Billing Date Changes
        Send the `next_billing_at` to set the next billing date for the
        subscription. After that date passes and the subscription is
        processed, the following billing date will be set according to the
        subscription's product period.
        Note that if you pass an invalid date, we will automatically interpret
        and set the correct date. For example, when February 30 is entered,
        the next billing will be set to March 2nd in a non-leap year.
        The server response will not return data under the key/value pair of
        `next_billing`. Please view the key/value pair of
        `current_period_ends_at` to verify that the `next_billing` date has

        ### Snap Day Changes
        For a subscription using Calendar Billing, setting the next billing
        date is a bit different. Send the `snap_day` attribute to change the
        calendar billing date for **a subscription using a product eligible
        for calendar billing**.
        Note: If you change the product associated with a subscription that
        contains a `snap_date` and immediately `READ/GET` the subscription
        data, it will still contain evidence of the existing `snap_date`. This
        is due to the fact that a product change is instantanous and only
        affects the product associated with a subscription. After the
        `next_billing` date arrives, the `snap_day` associated with the
        subscription will return to `null.` Another way of looking at this is
        that you willl have to wait for the next billing cycle to arrive
        before the `snap_date` will reset to `null`.

        """Does a PUT request to /subscriptions/{subscription_id}/override.json.

        This API endpoint allows you to set certain subscription fields that
        are usually managed for you automatically. Some of the fields can be
        set via the normal Subscriptions Update API, but others can only be
        set using this endpoint.
        This endpoint is provided for cases where you need to “align” Chargify
        data with data that happened in your system, perhaps before you
        started using Chargify. For example, you may choose to import your
        historical subscription data, and would like the activation and
        cancellation dates in Chargify to match your existing historical
        dates. Chargify does not backfill historical events (i.e. from the
        Events API), but some static data can be changed via this API.
        Why are some fields only settable from this endpoint, and not the
        normal subscription create and update endpoints? Because we want users
        of this endpoint to be aware that these fields are usually managed by
        Chargify, and using this API means **you are stepping out on your
        own.**
        Changing these fields will not affect any other attributes. For
        example, adding an expiration date will not affect the next assessment
        date on the subscription.
        If you regularly need to override the current_period_starts_at for new
        subscriptions, this can also be accomplished by setting both
        `previous_billing_at` and `next_billing_at` at subscription creation.
        See the documentation on [Importing
        Subscriptions](./b3A6MTQxMDgzODg-create-subscription#subscriptions-impo
        rt) for more information.
        ## Limitations
        When passing `current_period_starts_at` some validations are made:
        1. The subscription needs to be unbilled (no statements or invoices).
        2. The value passed must be a valid date/time. We recommend using the
        iso 8601 format.
        3. The value passed must be before the current date/time.
        If unpermitted parameters are sent, a 400 HTTP response is sent along
        with a string giving the reason for the problem.

        The Chargify API allows you to preview a subscription by POSTing the

        ## Side effects
        A subscription will not be created by sending a POST to this endpoint.
        It is meant to serve as a prediction.
        ## Taxable Subscriptions
        This endpoint will preview taxes applicable to a purchase. In order
        for taxes to be previewed, the following conditions must be met:
        + Taxes must be configured on the subscription
        + The preview must be for the purchase of a taxable product or
        component, or combination of the two.
        + The subscription payload must contain a full billing or shipping
        address in order to calculate tax
        For more information about creating taxable previews, please see our
        documentation guide on how to create [taxable
        subscriptions.](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/44079042
        17755#creating-taxable-subscriptions)
        You do **not** need to include a card number to generate tax
        information when you are previewing a subscription. However, please
        note that when you actually want to create the subscription, you must
        include the credit card information if you want the billing address to
        be stored in Chargify. The billing address and the credit card
        information are stored together within the payment profile object.
        Also, you may not send a billing address to Chargify without payment
        profile information, as the address is stored on the card.
        You can pass shipping and billing addresses and still decide not to
        calculate taxes. To do that, pass `skip_billing_manifest_taxes: true`
        attribute.
        ## Non-taxable Subscriptions
        If you'd like to calculate subscriptions that do not include tax,
        please feel free to leave off the billing information.

        ## Query Parameters vs Request Body Parameters
        Passing in a coupon code as a query parameter will add the code to the
        subscription, completely replacing all existing coupon codes on the
        subscription.
        For this reason, using this query parameter on this endpoint has been
        deprecated in favor of using the request body parameters as described
        below. When passing in request body parameters, the list of coupon
        codes will simply be added to any existing list of codes on the
        subscription.

            code (str, optional): A code for the coupon that would be applied

        Chargify offers the ability to activate awaiting signup and trialing
        subscriptions. This feature is only available on the Relationship
        Invoicing architecture. Subscriptions in a group may not be activated
        immediately.
        For details on how the activation works, and how to activate
        subscriptions through the application, see [activation](#).
        The `revert_on_failure` parameter controls the behavior upon
        activation failure.
        - If set to `true` and something goes wrong i.e. payment fails, then
        Chargify will not change the subscription's state. The subscription’s
        billing period will also remain the same.
        - If set to `false` and something goes wrong i.e. payment fails, then
        Chargify will continue through with the activation and enter an end of
        life state. For trialing subscriptions, that will either be trial
        ended (if the trial is no obligation), past due (if the trial has an
        obligation), or canceled (if the site has no dunning strategy, or has
        a strategy that says to cancel immediately). For awaiting signup
        subscriptions, that will always be canceled.
        The default activation failure behavior can be configured per
        activation attempt, or you may set a default value under Config >
        Settings > Subscription Activation Settings.
        ## Activation Scenarios
        ### Activate Awaiting Signup subscription
        - Given you have a product without trial
        - Given you have a site without dunning strategy
        ```mermaid
          flowchart LR
            AS[Awaiting Signup] --> A{Activate}
            A -->|Success| Active
            A -->|Failure| ROF{revert_on_failure}
            ROF -->|true| AS
            ROF -->|false| Canceled
        ```
        - Given you have a product with trial
        - Given you have a site with dunning strategy
        ```mermaid
          flowchart LR
            AS[Awaiting Signup] --> A{Activate}
            A -->|Success| Trialing
            A -->|Failure| ROF{revert_on_failure}
            ROF -->|true| AS
            ROF -->|false| PD[Past Due]
        ```
        ### Activate Trialing subscription
        You can read more about the behavior of trialing subscriptions
        [here](https://maxio-chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/54044946173
        57#trialing-subscriptions-0-0).
        When the `revert_on_failure` parameter is set to `true`, the
        subscription's state will remain as Trialing, we will void the invoice
        from activation and return any prepayments and credits applied to the
        invoice back to the subscription.
