        on_failed_payment (FailedPaymentAction): Action taken when payment for
            an invoice fails: - `leave_open_invoice` - prepayments and credits
            applied to invoice; invoice status set to "open"; email sent to
            the customer for the issued invoice (if setting applies); payment
            failure recorded in the invoice history. This is the default
            option. - `rollback_to_pending` - prepayments and credits not
            applied; invoice remains in "pending" status; no email sent to the
            customer; payment failure recorded in the invoice history. -
            `initiate_dunning` - prepayments and credits applied to the
            invoice; invoice status set to "open"; email sent to the customer
            for the issued invoice (if setting applies); payment failure
            recorded in the invoice history; subscription will  most likely go
            into "past_due" or "canceled" state (depending upon net terms and
