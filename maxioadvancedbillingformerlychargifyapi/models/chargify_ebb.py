    TODO: type model description here.

    Attributes:
        timestamp (str): This timestamp determines what billing period the
            event will be billed in. If your request payload does not include
            it, Chargify will add `chargify.timestamp` to the event payload
            and set the value to `now`.
        id (str): A unique ID set by Chargify. Please note that this field is
            reserved. If `chargify.id` is present in the request payload, it
            will be overwritten.
        created_at (str): An ISO-8601 timestamp, set by Chargify at the time
            each event is recorded. Please note that this field is reserved.
            If `chargify.created_at` is present in the request payload, it
            will be overwritten.
        uniqueness_token (str): User-defined string scoped per-stream.
            Duplicate events within a stream will be silently ignored. Tokens
            expire after 31 days.
