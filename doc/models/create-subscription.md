| `payment_collection_method` | [`PaymentCollectionMethod`](../../doc/models/payment-collection-method.md) | Optional | The type of payment collection to be used in the subscription.

| `customer_id` | `int` | Optional | The ID of an existing customer within Chargify. Required, unless a `customer_reference` or a set of `customer_attributes` is given. |
| `next_billing_at` | `str` | Optional | (Optional) Set this attribute to a future date/time to sync imported subscriptions to your existing renewal schedule. See the notes on “Date/Time Format” in our [subscription import documentation](https://maxio-chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5404863655821#date-format). If you provide a next_billing_at timestamp that is in the future, no trial or initial charges will be applied when you create the subscription. In fact, no payment will be captured at all. The first payment will be captured, according to the prices defined by the product, near the time specified by next_billing_at. If you do not provide a value for next_billing_at, any trial and/or initial charges will be assessed and charged at the time of subscription creation. If the card cannot be successfully charged, the subscription will not be created. See further notes in the section on Importing Subscriptions. |
| `initial_billing_at` | `str` | Optional | (Optional) Set this attribute to a future date/time to create a subscription in the "Awaiting Signup" state, rather than "Active" or "Trialing".

In the "Awaiting Signup" state, a subscription behaves like any other. It can be canceled, allocated to, had its billing date changed. etc. When the initial_billing_at date hits, the subscription will transition to the expected state. If the product has a trial, the subscription will enter a trial, otherwise it will go active. Setup fees will be respected either before or after the trial, as configured on the price point. If the payment is due at the initial_billing_at and it fails the subscription will be immediately canceled. See further notes in the section on Delayed Signups. |
